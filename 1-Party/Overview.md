# Party Formation
All four of us were in a tavern at the same time. Guiles recognized Keokin from the gladitorial arena from when he occasionally visits to watch the fights, Guiles would come and play dice back when Keokin was a prisoner and they had a slight rapport. Keokin was playing dice when Guiles intervened in his game because he noticed the opponent was cheating. Later in the evening Loralot is nervously watching the room, trying to build enough courage to talk and make acquaintances with other travelers. When she notices the cheater from earlier slipping poison into Guiles and Keokin’s drinks. Loralot is able to muster the courage to talk to them and let them know, Guiles and Keokin start a bar fight with the cheater/poisoner as a result. Morgana who was finishing running some errands comes into the tavern and is able to pull Keokin, Guiles, and Loralot away from the scene.
