- Heroes came across a town (name?) and met lizardfolk that have moss growing on their shoulders, head, and back; seems the older or elders have more, longer moss.
    
- They encounter Arendel first who advises them they might want to head to the tavern if seeking work.
    
- Party got slightly distracted on the way to the inn/tavern by sprites in the fields seemingly playing and before investigating were warned by Taco (Tama) to leave the sprites be.
    
- Party headed to the tavern and met with Naway, the mayor of the town, who gave the party information on the town and how they were known for being a cider manufacturing hub. Also this is a dry town because of pacts or the rituals they have with the mother tree and/or sprites
    
- While chatting Giles and Keokin headed to the barkeep to get ciders, Giles was quite unhappy with the ‘kids’ cider and spit out the non-alcoholic cider, seeing this Keokin burst out laughing and asked the barkeep for an ale. To his disappointment was told they don’t serve that kind of drink
    
- Giles and Keokin rejoin the others in the conversation that Kaleena, an elder lizardfolk in town has been acting strangely and quite preoccupied with something on her mind.
    
- Lauralot having strong druidic ties to this imbalance in nature expressed she wanted to approach Kaleena, but was nervous about meeting such an elder figure. With the help from Morgana, she was able to build up the courage to greet and find out Kaleena’s concern. Something was off with the mother tree and that the sprites have been acting oddly lately.
    
- Wanting to investigate further our group headed off into the fields and as the energy around them darkened and feeling more oppressed, they came across thorny sprite creatures. Giles stealthily investigated, finding 5 of these creatures barring the party's travels.
    
- The young Taco was traveling with them as a guide to the mother tree, and being a young Lizardfolk wanted to experience adventure and excitement joined in with Keokin to steel their resolve and pressed that the party not be afraid and to go through the dark creatures.
    
- While Giles, Morgana, and Lauralot took more advantageous positions and used cover; Keokin seeing the tiny weeds before them openly approached and wanted to get the attention of the sprites so Lauralot might be able to communicate with them.
    
- Shaking a tree branch was the wrong way to get their attention and the sprites became hostile to our party
    
- Giles, seeing the danger set upon them, fired his short bow racking through the first one, destroying it in a blow before darting back into the shadows.
    
- Lauralot channeled the nature around the sprites and sent vines from the ground to grasp and restrain 3 of the creatures. 2 of the sprites joyfully took control of the vines and started dancing with them, while the 3rd was wrapped completely and unable to move.
    
- Morgana focusing on the void, shot a blast at a far one, but was unable to hit instead it blast straight into the tree
    
- Keokin rushed in throwing a hand axe at the closest one, ripping straight through it and ending it
    
- The party continued to battle the remaining sprites dispatching them, but not before Lauralot felt an ominous dark energy emanating from ahead.
    
- Taco, feeling energetic from the heroes fighting, attempted to charge in with a bucket. Leaping over Keokin to attack a sprite, when he swung down he missed the target and ended falling on top of some nearby thorns
    
- Once the sprites were disposed of, our group gathered and continued on their way.
    
- Ahead Lauralot recognized the dark energy from before in the form of a Dryad casting some ritual on the Mother Tree, dark-thorny vines were growing up the tree
    
- Seeing the threat to such a precious entity of the Lizardfolk, our party spreads out getting ready to strike.
    
- Guiles and Morgana both fire upon the Dryad only to realize some magic barrier surrounds their enemy.  The Hex bolt bursts and the arrow shatters, leaving the Dryad unscathed.
    
- Lauralot takes cover behind a tree and casts Guidance on Keokin as he charges toward the Dryad.
    
- Keokin’s Glave cuts through the air only to be stopped suddenly by the impenetrable shield.
    
- The Dryad, never losing focus of her corrupting spell on the Mother Tree, raises a hand and snaps her fingers.  Suddenly 4 corrupted Pixies burst forth from the surrounding thorny vines.
    
- Guiles and Morgana set upon the new enemies, damaging, but not quite killing two of them.
    
- Keokin seeing the Dryad continue to focus on her chanting and the shield blocking the blow of the parties attack, reaches in to grapple her through the shield.
    
- Successfully grabbing onto the Dryad, she begins to panic as her ritual is interrupted. She commands the Pixies to swarm Keokin and she summons a thundercloud above, striking Keokin with lightning
    
- The strike of lightning causes Keokin to release his grip on the Dryad and the pixies begin clawing into him, leaving one of our hero’s at death’s door.
    
- The remaining heroes strike back at the Pixies in an effort to gain a reprieve.
    
- Suddenly Taco charges in and finds Keokin’s glaive, using it to strike deftly at the Dryad with incredible precision. He is able to break through the seemingly impenetrable shield causing an explosion that sends Taco flying unconscious and destroying Keokin’s glaive.
    
- Using the distraction Taco has created, Guiles maneuvers to the 2 Pixies surrounding Keokin on the ground and strikes into one with his rapier, destroying it and sending a thorny explosion from the monster’s body which hits its ally Pixies. The thorny explosion is enough to defeat the second Pixie and it too explodes in a chain reaction.
    
- The Dryad sensing the tides shifting focus a teleportation spell that allows an escape from our heroes, thus causing the remaining Pixies to dissipate
    
- Wiles takes quick action because weasel CPR on Keokin, miraculously reviving the Giant.
    
- As Keokin regains awareness, he realizes that his glaive was destroyed and is quite saddened. Seeing this Lauralot uses her Druidic expertise to cast a spell to Mend the broken weapon and repair its glory.
    
- With the danger past, our heroes recover their facilities before having Lauralot commune with the Mother Tree.
    
- The Mother Tree indicates that the threat is still present in the grove and while the immediate danger is gone it could come back if given time to recover.
    
- In a hurry, Guiles, unable to wake Taco leaves a note with him for when he recovers to head to town and bring any tonics or helpful equipment that would assist in their coming battles.
    
- They are able to quickly locate the Dryad and she is again found chanting a ritual, this time into a heap of leaves, vines, and foliage.
    
- With a plan to surprise and ambush the Dryad, they leap into battle.
    
- Leading the charge, Keokin rushes in to deliver a gash with his now repaired glaive.
    
- Guiles and Lauralot launch arrows and firebolts, however they are unsuccessful in their aim
    
- Morgana curses the Dryad with a Hex in order to weaken it further
    
- The Dryad caught off guard, again summons corrupted Pixies to assist in protecting her for the ritual
    
- Shortly after the Dryad fuses with the mess of leafs, foliage, and vines in front of her causing a massive transformation. An amalgamation of plants and nature combined to the Dryad leaving a towering figure overlooking our heroes.
    
- Our party, sensing the danger, focuses with immense concentration on their following attacks. In a combination of blows, each dealing devastating injuries, the towering beast causes the Dryad to falter.
    
- Morgana uses the power of her curse, sendings a lethal blow of Eldritch energy ripping straight through the Dryad. As the Dryad collapsed in defeat, its summoned Pixies disappeared from existence.
